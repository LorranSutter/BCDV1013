## Lab 04: EVM Assembly

Modify the solidity program below to compute the following function:

<div align="center">

![Equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$f\(a,b\)=\(a%2Bb\)^{3}\cdot\(a-2\))

</div>

- Use the Remix Solidity IDE to develop and test your program
- Do it with "non-functional" assembly expressions. You only need swapN, dupN, add, sub, mul, and (optionally) exp. Ignore the deprecation - warnings, you will learn the functional notation later.
- See the list of EVM opcodes for reference.
- Test case: Evaluating f(5,6) should return 3993
- Your submission should be the solidity program.
