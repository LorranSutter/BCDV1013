## Lab 06: Optimize Contract

Modify the solidity program below to minimize the gas costs.

- Use the techniques described during the lesson.
- Don't forget to enable optimization in compiler settings.
- Check that gas usage is going down by using the Compilation Details in remix, and by testing transactions.
- Not all optimizations will show up in the gas estimates, since they are worst-case figures.
- You should be able to get the creation totalCost below 180,000 and the transferBalance below 65,600.
- Your submission should be the modified solidity program.
